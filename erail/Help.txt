This is a simple bash script which gives you the current availability of any train. --> IMP: Currently script will show proper output if seats are available else if ticket is in waiting list or train does not run on that day/any other issue then the script wont show proper errors
Note: this script is basically designed for UNIX/LINUX systems.On windows you will have to install Cygwin(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6413377/is-there-a-way-to-run-bash-scripts-on-windows)
First unzip the erail.zip file using : "unzip erail.zip"(without quotes" and then do : cd erail  and then bash erail.sh
and then specify train number,source station code and destination station code(in capital letters), specify the type of coach you want,then specify the date(only the date), then the  month number
One sample Example is as follows:
57563
HYB
NED
SL
18
2
which represents train number 57563 from hyderabad to nanded sleeper class on 18 th feb 2016.Currently the script works for General QUOTA of reservation.If availabilty is less than or equal to a specified number,a desktop notification is displayed and also an email is sent but currently because the requests go through a proxy server so the mail sytem works only for my college's email addresses.Configuring SMTP will helpto overcome this problem
