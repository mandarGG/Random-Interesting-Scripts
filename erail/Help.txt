This is a simple bash script which gives you the current seat availability of any train. 
Note: this script is basically designed for UNIX/LINUX systems.On windows you will have to install Cygwin(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6413377/is-there-a-way-to-run-bash-scripts-on-windows)

There are 2 ways to run the script. One is to fix the train specifications i.e when you want to check for a particular train, for that you can do : cd erail  and then edit the myerail.sh file via vim/sublime/gedit etc. Put your train specifications in that order by replacing the value of each of the variables:specify train number,source station code and destination station code(in capital letters), specify the type of coach you want,then specify the date(only the date), then the  month number,and then limit below which notifications for low availabilty start( Refer below example ). You can use crontabs to run this script automatially whenever you want
Refer : http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/06/15-practical-crontab-examples/


The second way is to input these tarin specifications by hand. For that,do : cd erail  and then bash erail.sh
and then specify train number,source station code and destination station code(in capital letters), specify the type of coach you want,then specify the date(only the date), then the  month number,and then limit below which notifications for low availabilty start
One sample Example is as follows:
57563
HYB
NED
SL
18
2
20
which represents train number 57563 from hyderabad to nanded sleeper class on 18 th feb 2016.Currently the script works for General QUOTA of reservation.If availabilty is less than or equal to a specified number(20 here above) or RAC or WL ,a desktop notification is displayed and also an email is sent but currently the mail feature is not working because of some issues though if you use crontab email feature is embedded in it.
